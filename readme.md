## Files:
-  Makefile - build file
- main.cpp - source code file: driver program
- seamCarve.hpp - source code file: header file for seam carve
- seamCarve.cpp - source code file: implementation file for seam carve
- Buchtel_processed_100_0.pgm - processed pgm file with 100 vertical and 0 horizontal seam carves.
- Buchtel_processed_50_20.pgm - processed pgm file with 50 vertical and 20 horizontal seam carves. 
***

## To run the program, run the following commands:

- build the program  
`$ make all`  

- run the program  
`$ ./seamCarve <filename> verticalSeams horizontal verticalSeams`

*For example, if you want to carve 100 vertical and 50 horizonal seams from the file CAS.pgm,*  
*run the following command:*  
*`$ ./seamCarve CAS.pgm 100 50`*

*The file generated by seam carving is saved as <filename>_processed.pgm
For example, if you carved the file called CAS.pgm, the generated file is
saved as CAS_processed.pgm*

- To clean the objective files, eg: .obj, .o that were generated by make, run the command:  
`$ make clean`

## The purpose of the program:

This program uses a dynammic programming to carve the vertical and horizonal seams. 

## What is Dynammic programming?
> Dynammic programming is a technique to define the problem recursively and 
   design the solution to work from bottom to top.
